# Optimizing CTGAN-ENN in Customer Churn Prediction: A Cost-Sensitive Learning Perspective


## Introduction
we aim to enhance the performance of several classical machine learning algorithms, including Decision
Trees (DT), Logistic Regression (LR), and Support Vector Machines (SVM), in customer churn
prediction tasks.

## Objectives
- Optimizing customer churn prediction result by extend the CTGAN-ENN with cost-sensitive learning perspective
- Evaluate the performance of prediction using F1-score, AUC, and G-Mean metric
- Ivestigate how robust is the classical machine learning algorithm on this area

## Discussion


## Conclusion


## Future Work
add some extension on CTGAN method such as an anomaly detection method on CTGAN to make sure the synthetic data produced are not outliers.
